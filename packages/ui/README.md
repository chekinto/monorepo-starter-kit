# üß¨ Atomic Design System

This package provides the **Design System** for our applications ‚Äî a unified library of reusable components, tokens, and patterns following the **Atomic Design methodology**.
It lives inside the monorepo under `packages/ui` and is shared across all client applications.

## üìñ Overview

The Design System ensures a **consistent, accessible, and scalable** user experience across products.  
It is built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vanilla Extract CSS**, structured according to **Atomic Design principles**:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Atomic Design Layers

### **1. Atoms** - The smallest, most fundamental UI building blocks.

Examples:

- `Avatar`, `Button`, `Icon`, `Input`, `Text`,
- Each atom is **pure**, **stateless**, and styled using design tokens.

Guidelines:

- Use only **tokens** for colors, spacing, and typography (no hardcoded values).
- Keep atoms accessible (`aria-*`, keyboard focus, contrast).
- No business logic.

### **2. Molecules** - Groups of atoms working together to form a reusable pattern.

Examples:

- `InputField` (Input + Label + Error message)
- `Card` (Container + Title + Actions)
- `Modal` (Overlay + Card + Buttons)

Guidelines:

- Encapsulate layout and relationships between atoms.
- Avoid API complexity; keep props composable.
- Support state and events (e.g. open/close, validation).

---

### **3. Organisms** - Complex UI sections made up of multiple molecules and/or atoms.

Examples:

- `Header`, `Footer`, `Sidebar`, `FormSection`, `ProductCardList`

Guidelines:

- Handle layout composition.
- Begin to incorporate real data props (but still UI-focused).
- Organisms are shared between templates or pages.

### **4. Templates** - Page-level wireframes that define layout structure using organisms.

Examples:

- `AuthLayout`, `DashboardLayout`

Guidelines:

- Define placement and hierarchy of organisms.
- Should not contain business logic.
- Accept children and layout configuration props.

### **5. Pages** - Final view composition using templates populated with real data.

Examples:

- `AccountPage`, `DashboardPage`, `HomePage`,

Guidelines:

- Pages connect to data fetching (via app layer).
- Typically live inside the app project, but examples exist here for Storybook docs and visual testing.

## üé® Theming

The design system supports **multiple brands and modes** (e.g. light/dark).  
It uses **Vanilla Extract CSS** with a `themeContract`, `sprinkles API` and `recipes API` to guarantee consistent variable names across themes.

Below is the current theme skeleton when creating a new brand/client

Example:

```ts
export const replaceWithThemeName = createTheme(tokens, {
  background: {
    hero: "",
